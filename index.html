    Welcome! My name is Theo, and i'm currenctly studying to become a full-stack developer 
    at Chas Academy. I live with my partner in Täby, just north of Stockholm where i try
    to balance student life with my personal interests. <br><br>
    I've always been fascinated by how things work, not just within computers and programming, 
    but in many different areas. Cars, business and economics are fields that spark my curiosity
    daily. That curiosity drives me to constantly learn and push myself to grow, both as a developer
    and as a person. <br><br>
    In my free time, i like to recharge in two different ways: fishing and gaming. Fishing gives me
    peace and a chance to connect with nature, while gaming lets me escape reality in a completely 
    different enviroment.

    <section class="whyThisEducation">
        <h2>Why am i studying this?</h2>
        <p>I chose to study Fullstack .NET at Chas Academy because i wanted to try something new. I have always had an interest for computers and IT
            and have programmed small hobby projects on my own before. In combination with this i was growing tired of my current job, and wanted to
            see what a career in IT could bring me. <br><br>
            After my education i would love to work as a project based consultant. This way i will not be stuck working or improving a single system
            or program for a specific company. My preference would be to plan and create one project at a time, from vision to final product.
