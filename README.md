**Welcome to my training portfolio website**ðŸ’»

During the first two weeks at Chas Academy, we were assigned a project to create an entry-level portfolio/about me website.
This project serves as both a learning exercise and a showcase of my progress as a full-stack developer student. 

I will be continuosly working on and improving this site as i gain more skills and experience. I started with simple HTML and CSS, and will gradually add more complexity, interactivity and polish over time. 

This project will be presented and further refined during the Chas Academy Hackathon event on September 12th ðŸ“…, where i will demonstrate what i've learned so far and continue developing new features.
